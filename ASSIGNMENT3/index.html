            <p> <b>Mr. Okorie Lloyd,</b> The biography is a comprehensive personal account of another individual’s life story. Discussed in the biography are basic details of the subject’s life such as birthplace, interests, and education. It also includes
                significant events during the subject’s childhood, relationship with family members, and how they influenced their upbringing. But while the biography states the person’s life events and achievements, it isn’t only centered on the facts
                and figures but also excellent stories from start to finish.</p>
            <p> <b>His Social Achievements</b> When writing a professional biography, you’re expected to write a mid-length description of your professional goals, current role, and biggest accomplishments. You can choose to do this either on professional
                websites such as AngelList or LinkedIn. With that said, you’re accepted to add a bit more details when writing a professional bi,o unlike bios usually posted on social media sites such as LinkedIn.</p>
