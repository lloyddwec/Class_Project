    <h2 class="h1">Blogging</h2>
    <p class="p1"> <b>Blogging</b> is one 0f the news ways to distribute information. You must have heard the term “blog” or “weblog” and you’re probably thinking “what is a blog and what’s it all about?” Let’s make this clear, when I was in college, a lot of people
        talked about “blogs” and “blogging”, but back then I never knew exactly what it was, never mind how to go about creating a blog or knowing which were the best blog hosting sites! I had absolutely no idea…</p>
    <p class="p2">Fortunately, I’ve now published and managed many different blogs, so I can truly say I know what blogging is (check out our free blogging course at the button on the top of the page if you want help starting one).</p>
    <p class="p3"> <b>So what is a blog?</b> A blog is very similar to a website. I would say that a blog is a diary/journal that is (mostly) maintained by one person – blogger. Usually, blogs are being updated quite often (once a day, once a week, once a month). Blogs
        can be private, but most of them are available on the internet for others to see. Blogs have certain topics. My blog’s topic is “blogging” and “how to start one” – I’m helping beginners to start a blog, get more visitors and much more… BUT, it
        can also have several other topics. Bloggers are usually passionate about a specific topic thus they’ll create one.
